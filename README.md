Open the main folder in Visual Studio Code

If you don't have node.js, then install it.

Then, open 2 terminals in that main folder.

Use "cd client" and "cd server" in both terminals.

Then, use "npm i" in both terminals to install node modules in client and server respectively.

After Installing node modules, go to client terminal and use "npm run dev" to start the front-end website.

Then, go to server terminal and use "nodemon server.js" to start the back-end server.

Now, both front-end and back-end servers are running.

Go to http://localhost:5173/ to start surfing the website, have fun!
